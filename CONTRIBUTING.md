> **WIP document**

# Introduction
First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing, which are hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

By improving documentation, writing tutorials, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the project, etc. all examples of helpful contributions that could help and are very welcome.
Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

# Ground Rules

## Responsibilities

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
- Ensure that code that goes into core meets a minimum requirements.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Your First Contribution

## Unsure where to begin contributing?

You can start by looking through [help wanted](https://github.com/FerMod/EventDispatcher/labels/help%20wanted) issues.

## Working on your first Pull Request?

You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Feel free to ask for help, everyone is a beginner at first.
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

### Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.
How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:

* Let them know if they need to sign a CLA, agree to a DCO, or get any other legal stuff out of the way
* If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain how to run the tests
* If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or Trac), let them know which tools they’ll need to contribute

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

### If you have a different process for small or "obvious" fixes, let them know.

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
### Explain security disclosures first!
At bare minimum, include this sentence:
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

If you don’t want to use your personal contact information, set up a “security@” email address. Larger projects might have more formal processes for disclosing security, including encrypted communication. (Disclosure: I am not a security expert.)

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@travis-ci.org
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org.

### Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
> General questions should go to the golang-nuts mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

> The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.
>
> Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

[source: [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express#philosophy)] **Need more inspiration?** [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin#goals)

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the puppet-dev list. Notes are posted to the Puppet Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time.

> You can chat with the core team on https://gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber. We try to have office hours on Fridays.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

#### Use the imperative tense

When displayed on the web, it's often styled as a heading, and in emails, it's typically used as the subject. As such, you should capitalize it and omit any trailing punctuation. Consistent wording makes it easier to mentally process a list of commits.

Examples:

`Add feature` not ~~`Added feature`~~
`Fix bug` not ~~`Fixed bug`~~ or ~~`Fixes bug`~~

#### Limit the first line to 72 characters or less

The first line of a commit message serves as a summary. When it's not, add a blank line (this is important) followed the rest of the commit message.
When refering to issues and pull requests try to reference them.

Example:

```tex
Add feature

Description in more detail of the commit if needed.
With synxtax like '#3' references issues and pull request and with 'close #3', can autoclose them.
```

### Use of labels in issues and pull request

The use of labels in issues and pull request is not a requeriment but a suggestion that certainly helps the filtering and sorting.
These are the [current project labels](https://github.com/FerMod/EventDispatcher/labels).
